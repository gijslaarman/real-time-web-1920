# Tweets against Twitter.
A mash-up of tweets, replies and bringing out the worst in a human ðŸ§¨.

### In short
The server collects popular tweets and a couple of their replies. Puts the tweets & replies in a big pot and distributes them under the players. The functionalities are the same as Cards Against Humanities.â„¢ but spiced up by randomizing the twitter feed.

### Challenges
Fully random is not the way to go probably, there will have to be some filters to keep it interesting. Will have to see how it will pan out.
Does the Twitter API support my idea? Will have to find out.
